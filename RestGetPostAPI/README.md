A basic Spring Boot application using Rest API and Spring WEB which aims to perform given operation.

1. To insert student details (POST API)
2. To retreive Student details (GET API)

Note: `ArrayList` is used to store the student information and this application has no front-end interface hence we have to use some  API platform for building and using APIs (Example [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/))
